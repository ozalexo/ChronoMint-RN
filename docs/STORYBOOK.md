    ```bash
    yarn add -D @storybook/cli@4.0.0 @storybook/addon-info@4.0.0 
    ```
2. Initialize [StoryBook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)
    ```bash
    ./node_modules/.bin/sb init -f -p babel
    ```

## Launch

1. You will need two terminals
    * Terminal 1:
        ```bash
        yarn run storybook
        ```
    * Terminal 2 (or just lauch the App via XCode/Android Studio):
        ```bash
        react-native run-ios
        ```
        or/and
